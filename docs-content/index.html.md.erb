Redis Enterprise (Redis<sup>e</sup>) Pack clusters are enterprise grade, highly available and scalable Redis clusters with substantially lower operational overhead than any other Redis deployment method.

Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack extends open source Redis and delivers tangible benefits of stable high performance, zero-downtime linear scaling and hassle-free true high availability, with significant operational savings.

This documentation describes Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).
Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack for PCF exposes its service plans on the Marketplace.
Developers can provision highly available and scalable Redis databases by creating instances of the service plans using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI).
