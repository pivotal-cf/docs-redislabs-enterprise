**Release Date:** January 21, 2018

### New Features

**Geo-Distributed Active-Active Conflict-free Replicated Databases (CRDB) Across Multiple VMware Tanzu Foundations**
Developing globally distributed applications can be challenging. Developers have to think about race conditions and complex combinations of events under geo-failovers and cross-region write conflicts. CRDBs simplify developing such applications by directly using built-in smarts for handling conflicting writes based on the data type in use. Instead of depending on just simplistic "last-writer-wins" type conflict resolution, geo-distributed CRDBs combines techniques defined in CRDT (conflict-free replicated data types) research with Redis types to provide smart and automatic conflict resolution based on the data type's intent. This also includes support for TCP Routers.

For information, see [Developing with CRDBs](https://www.redislabs.com/redis-enterprise-documentation/developing/crdbs/").

- VMware Tanzu CRDB Integration using VMware Tanzu TCP Router 16720, 16721
- CRDB Support without DNS (doc item #6) and 16711
- Tile uses VMware Tanzu system domain to deploy tile 16045


## <a id="ver"></a> v5.0.0 (BETA)

**Release Date:** December 6, 2017

### New Features

**Support for Redis Cluster API**<br>
The Redis Cluster API support in Redis Enterprise provides a simple mechanism for Cluster-enabled Redis clients to learn and know the cluster topology. This enables clients to connect directly to an RP proxy on the node hosting the master shard for the data being operated on. As a result, all but the initial call to get the cluster topology or reacquire the location of the master shard, and the client will connect to the RP endpoint proxy where the master shard is located. <a href="https://www.redislabs.com/redis-enterprise-documentation/concepts-architecture/data-access/cluster-api/">Learn more about the Cluster API implementation</a>.

**Redis Modules**<br>
Redis Modules enable you to extend the functionality of Redis Enterprise Pack. You can add new data types, capabilities, and more to tailor the cluster to a specific use case or need. Once installed, modules benefit from the high performance, scalability, and high availability that Redis Enterprise is known for.

**Redis Labs' Modules**

There are three modules Redis Labs has developed and certified with Redis Enterprise Pack. The modules are:

* [RediSearch](https://www.redislabs.com/redis-enterprise-documentation/developing/modules/redisearch/) - This module turns Redis Enterprise into a supercharged, distributed, in-memory, full-text indexing and search beast.
* [ReJSON](https://www.redislabs.com/redis-enterprise-documentation/developing/modules/rejson/) - Now you have the convenience of JSON as a built-in data type and can address nested data via a path easily.
* [ReBloom](https://www.redislabs.com/redis-enterprise-documentation/developing/modules/bloom-filters/) - Enables Redis Enterprise to have a scalable bloom filter as a data type. Bloom filters are probabilistic data structures that quickly determine if something is contained within a set.


**Custom Modules**

In addition, Redis Enterprise provides the ability to load and use custom modules from [redismodules.com](http://redismodules.com/) or of your own creation.

**LDAP Integration**

As part of our continued emphasis on security, administrative user accounts in Redis Enterprise can now either use built-in authentication or authenticate externally via LDAP with saslauthd. The accounts can be used for administering resources on the cluster through the command line, Rest API, or Web UI.

For more information, see [LDAP Integration](https://www.redislabs.com/redis-enterprise-documentation/administering/security/ldap-integration/).

**Additional Capabilities**

Support for additional Redis commands and features:

* Support for Redis v4.0.2

**Information**

* In the node bootstrap API, the structure of the JSON has changed for adding an external IP during the bootstrap process.
