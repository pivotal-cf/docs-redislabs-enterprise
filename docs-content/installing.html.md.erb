1. Navigate to the **Cluster Configuration** section on the left navigation bar. Enter the following details:
 * **Cluster Name**: Provide a subdomain for the cluster name. The Redis Enterprise cluster name is a subdomain under the system domain, which is found under the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) in Ops Manager (PAS->Settings->Domains). For example, set the cluster name as `CLUSTERNAME.sys.redislabs.com` if your system domain is `sys.redislabs.com`. The cluster name specified, represents part of the connection string for Redis apps when connecting to Redis Enterprise databases using DNS-based connections.
 * **Admin Email**: Provide an email for the account that will have full administrative privileges to the new Redis Enterprise cluster.
 * **Admin account password**: Provide the password for the administrative account.
 * Optionally, for production clusters, you can also provide a static IP address of a set of static IP addresses (comma seperated) to use for cluster nodes. You can also enabled Multiple Availability Zone (Rack) awareness.
 * Save your changes by clicking **Save**.<br />![Import button](./images/pcf_rp_config_full_screen2.png)
